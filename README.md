- Mobile-first workflow
- RWD Concept

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```scss
.nft-price {
            color: $cyan;
            font-size: 1.1rem;
            font-weight: 600;

            &::before {
                content: url('../../images/icon-ethereum.svg');
                margin-right: .3rem;
                transform: translateY(2px);
            }
        }
```
I learned the use of ::before pseudo-element for adding icon. This is a flexible way for adding icon before any elements as you don't have to hardcode it into your html element tag.

### Continued development

In the upcoming projects, I'll focus on the use of SCSS to smoothen my development process. Other than that, I tried to do more advanced projects that are available on Frontend Mentor. For example, projects that included the use of advanced layout properties like flexbox or grid.
